# DBM360_Wearable_Tech

This is a pretty straightforward project for a werable technologies class - a wearable jacket designed for cyclists that enhances 
visibility and safety. It uses sensors to detect environmental conditions and cyclist actions, triggering various outputs for 
communication and safety. Currently a work in progress.

It involves the following:

Three sensors
  - MPU6050 Accelerometer
  - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
  - a generic photoresistor for light detection

Three outputs:
  - LEDs
  - Audio buzzer
  - Vibration Motor
  - all of these are found in the Elegoo Arduino Uno Super Starter kit

And an Arduino UnoR3 board.
